## MonirothSuon.com website

This is a simple Django application that acts as my website. You can visit it here at [monirothsuon.com](http://monirothsuon.com).
The site is hosted with Apache2 using the mod_wsgi module. 
The blog posts in the site are written in MarkDown for easy formatting. The MarkDown is parsed with the [mistune](https://github.com/lepture/mistune) python API.

Enjoy!
